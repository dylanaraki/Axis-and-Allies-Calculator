# Axis-and-Allies-Calculator

I am starting this project just to help me in Axis & Allies games by providing probabilities of different numbers of hits with a given group of troops. Because I don't anticipate overly large inputs currently, I am currently only concerned with functionality, as I don't see performance mattering much. In the future, depending on interest, I may work on adding more Axis and Allies related applications to this project.
